        <ul>
            <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion then
                cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent (about 5 minutes). 
                Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
            </li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. 
                Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. 
                Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. 
                Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. 
                Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer.
